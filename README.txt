RIGHT NOW IT JUST SCAN BUT DOES NOT MOVE!!!
YOU NEED TO MOVE IT MANUALLY!!
I will change it with some easy movement.

You need to build robot from lego, with touch sensor in front and gyro sensor to see rotation of the Robot.

The Lego gyro sensor is s##t.

It is possible right now that there will be many errors but I will (probably XD) fix it later.

You need Labview 2013 or newer and Packages for MINDSTORMS Robotics.

You also need Unity 2019.1.0a7 or newer.

In the Robot_scanner file go to Assets and choose yess.unity.
Here choose build.cs and change the directory of your data.txt.
